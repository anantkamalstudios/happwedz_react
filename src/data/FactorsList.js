        title: 'Availability',
        content: "Once you have a wedding date, it's a good idea to ask if the venue is available on your wedding date. If they are available and you're clear on your priorities and the services they offer are suitable to you, ask how far in advance you can reserve the venue. Also ask if they do multiple weddings in one day."

        title: 'Rules',
        content: "It's a good idea to ask about any specific rules the venue has, such as noise-reduction, curfews, or protocols that your vendors should know about. What spaces do vendors have access to?"

        content: "Booking your wedding venue is one of the most important decisions in your wedding planning journey. The wedding venue you choose can set the theme for your wedding celebrations. Do you already have a theme and setup in mind? Did you envision a beach wedding or a glamorous night with white lights and candles all around in an open-air venue? Some couples also want their wedding to be steeped in traditions and prefer wedding halls with grand in-house wedding venue decoration. Couples who want a royal wedding, book palaces in India that are available to host weddings, or choose 5-star hotels that have state-of-the-art infrastructure."
